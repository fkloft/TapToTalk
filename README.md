TapToTalk
=========

This app was developed to have a permanently visible button for Push-To-Talk (PTT) applications. It was tested with Zello, but it should work with other apps if they use media buttons.

This app only generates media key events. You may need to configure your app to recognize these keys. In Zello, open advanced settings and set the PTT button.
